# Welcome

This research investigates the development of a novel design methodology for climate-resilient building envelopes in urban environments. The methodology focuses on the generation of differentiated geometric configurations informed by climatic simulations, with an emphasis on mono-material construction systems. This approach aims to address the growing need for sustainable and adaptable building designs that can effectively respond to the need of resilient urban environments.

### Architectural design principles for differentiated geometries
Investigating the relationship between geometry, digital fabrication, and environmental performance in the context of mono-material building envelopes. This includes the study of factors such as, brick patterns, solar radiation and thermal insulation.

### Development of a computational design tool
Creating a digital platform that enables designers to generate site-specific solutions based on climate-active design criteria. This tool will integrate climate simulation, material properties, and fabrication constraints to inform the design process.
